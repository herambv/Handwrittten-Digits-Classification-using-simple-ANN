# Handwrittten-Digits-Classification-using-simple-ANN
This project delves into the deep learning areas of Data Science , I have used basic ANN for the same. The dataset is loaded from keras i.e Mnist dataset. The accuracy of the model is 97 percent which is far better than Machine Learning algorithms , which shows us the power of neural networks.
